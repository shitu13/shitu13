<h2 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Shuvongkar Roy</h1>
<p align="left">Before I say anything let's look at the code snippet bellow. ðŸ˜‰

```C++
#iWrite <code> 
 
void life(Node* problem) {

    while (!problem->val) {
        try 
            "Handle it";
        catch (Exception e) 
            "Learn to handle it";
        finally() 
            "Eventually you will learn to handle it";
    }
    
    life(problem->next);
}
```

<p align="left"> I love metaphysical poetry but not as much as solving various problems. How I see life is a list of problems that are linked to one another. We solve one and move to the next one. So is engineering, we face problems, we overcome the barrier, we learn from them and move to the next one. Happy but never satisfied. And that's what makes things meaningful, cause we know no one can solve all the problems on his/her own be it engineering or be it life.

Metaphysical Poetry apart, I have a sound understanding of the following core CS subjects.
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Object Oriented Programming
- Database Management Systems
- Operating Systems
- Computer Networking
